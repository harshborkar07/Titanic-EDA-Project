# Titanic EDA Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of my internship task where I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.  
The goal was to clean the data, visualize key patterns, and summarize insights.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Google Colab (Python Notebook)
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Key Insights
- Most passengers were between **20–40 years** old.
- **More people did not survive** than survived.
- **Females had higher survival rate** than males.
- **First class passengers** had higher survival chances.
- **Fare** is positively related to survival.
